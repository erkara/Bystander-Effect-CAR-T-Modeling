# Bystander-Effect-CAR-T-Modeling
This repository included all the codes, dataset and other materials regarding our publication:
[Mathematical modeling insights into improving CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors with bystander effects](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-024-00435-4) at NPJ System Biology and Its Applications.
Here is a brief explanation the material present in the repo:

data: this folder has the data we extracted from [Klampatsa et.al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32802940/). 

meta_data: data we generated during our analysis.

virtual_patient_analysis: Matlab codes for generation and analysis of two virtual patient cohorts.

data_analysis.ipynb: Python code to reproduce most of the results in the paper. Detailed explanations are 

provided in the corresponding sections of the notebook.Other Matlab codes are self-explanatory with more descriptions within them. Please let us know if you need any question or help. You can send an email to erdikara@spelman.edu. If you find this repo useful please cite as
